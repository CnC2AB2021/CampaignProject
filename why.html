      <p class="article__paragraph">I am a kid just like you. I remember, before I was stranded on this island, living my life careless and blinded to much of the real world. I remember getting up early to go to school. Everyday was cheery, during school we got to play games, have fun, and enjoy ourselves.</p>
      <p class="article__paragraph">However, now that we are stuck here on this island, we are having fun: we are not happy. See this same story in many of the other boys, I wanted to stand up and change that.</p>
      <p class="article__paragraph">Here on this island, we will have fun, we will be happy, and we will return home happier than ever. But there are issues. There is work that needs to be done, there is a fire that needs tending, and there is a beast that needs to be taken care of.</p>
      <p class="article__paragraph">It may seem like a lot, but I believe in me, in us. I believe that we can make it through by sticking together. When we worked together to create the fire, it barely took an hour. If separated, no person can survive on their own. Escpecially if we are all fighting.</p>
      <p class="article__paragraph">We need to unite and support each other for that is the only way. We must unite, not fight.</p>
